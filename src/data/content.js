	 'about' : `You've managed to stumble upon my personal website, and you're probably looking to get to know more about me. Well, luckily I built this site for that very purpose.  There is information on my professional skills and hobbies, but nothing `,
	 'who' : `Who am I? I always find difficulty in answering this one because my perception of self is constantly changing.  Who are you at any given moment but simply a snapshot of how others view you along with your most notable achievements?  Sure, I could tell you that I'm a developer, photographer, designer, inventor, explorer, leader, innovator, knowledge-seeker, but would you really know me better as a result?  I prefer to show you why I am those things instead, so I'll use this space to summarize why I am the person I am today.`,
	 'childhood' : `Born and raised in Virginia Beach only 10 minutes from the oceanfront, I quickly got used to the sun and sand lifestyle.  Summer was the time to surf and skate, but it was also the time to work hard mowing lawns to make money for the winter. As an only child, I had the full attention of my parents and the full load of responsibilities.  Chores and straight A's were an expectation in my household and my "allowance" was the roof over my head, so every summer was a race to make as much money as possible. By the time I entered Ocean Lakes High School, I had a landscaping business with over 20 lawns and a website to back it.`,
	 'teenage' : ` Things were going pretty good until tragedy struck my family and my grandma was diagnosed with breast cancer my freshman year of high school.  It became a lot harder to focus in school but luckily I had wrestling to keep me busy and my family for support.  Thanks to the hard work of many wonderful doctors and more Relay For Life events than I can remember, my grandma made a full recovery over the next couple years.  I worked hard to get straight A's throughout high school, pushing myself in the class and mat room.  By my junior year, I had placed 7th in the state for wrestling and pushed my GPA above a 4.0. My parents always told me if I wanted to go to college I had better get a scholarship, so I did just that.  I was blessed with a full ride AFROTC scholarship at Virginia Tech, and off I head to college.`,
	 'college' : `The first three years of my college career were spent as a cadet in the VTCC and AFROTC. While I was unable to commission in the US Air Force, I learned more in those three years of personal and leadership development than I could've imagined. While I studied very hard through a rigirous computer science curriculum my first three years, I never truly had the time to delve into my major like I have the past year.  I branched out from web development to ux design to blockchain technologies to mobile app development.  Now I'm finding myself at the crossroads of a massive net of technological opportunity.  Now I'm finding that my passions outnumber the hours in the day I have to pursue them. Now is the time that I must hone in on one field of study and truly make an impact.`,
	 'leadership' : `My idea of what a leader should be has shifted dramatically through my college career.  As a freshman coming into the Corps of Cadets, I thought that the best leaders were the ones at the front.  Be the best at everything, have the best ideas, jump at every opportunity, go in early, leave late.  Now while some of these may be good leadership qualities, I realized over time that the best leader is one who can help others become better leaders. The person on the team who helps the leader shine when they aren't in a leadership role themselves. The person who helps team members recognize and utilize their strengths.  Maybe they aren't in the front but instead they're in the back pushing those who are struggling. I've learned that it isn't always about showing that you're the best but moreso about helping others become their best.`
